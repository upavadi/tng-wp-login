# Introduction
This widget replicates the Wordpress login/log out task and also logs into TNG ( The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding )](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/).

## Log In.
####  User may login using UserName or User Email and password.
  If UserName exists in TNG database, user is also logged into TNG.

## Password Reset: 
 - Some Wordpress Password-Reset routines are re-written. 
 -  Password reset is only allowed if the submitted email is in Wordpress database. 
 - If the submitted email is in TNG database only, email is sent to administrator with credential details and submitter is requested to await a response from the administrator.

## Registration Form: 
#### A registration form is included. New registrations are entered in Wordpress and TNG User tables. 
 - In TNG,  user awaits Review.
 - In Wordpress, user is allocated 'Subscriber' role. 
For this to be effective, deselect Membership: Anyone can register in Wordpress Dashboard>Settings. New user will receive an email generated by the plugin.

#### WP-TNG Integration
Integration is achieved by displaying TNG content within Wordpress wrapper. There are 2 main methods of acheiving this.

- CK Method: Replacing TNG Header and footers by Hard coding topmenu.php, footer.php and meta.php
    -  The widget works very well with the CK method
* MB Method: A plugin by Mark Barnes creates a Wordpress 'Post' to display TNG content within Worpress header.

    * At the moment, I am having problem getting it work consistently with MB Method. The plugin uses pseudo wordpress page to display TNG. I am having issues of WP-TNG Login widget work consistently with these pseudo redirects. .
 

issue
Tng page needs refrash to see login success.





#### The Widget has several useful features:




### Developed on TNG V10.1.3 and Wordpress V 4.9 - 5.1 platform.
### Tested PHP V 5.4 - 5.5, Wordpress 4.9 - 5.1 

# Registrtion
### If submitted User Name User Name is in WP or TNG  database and  submitted email is not, error 'User Name in use' is generated.
### If sumbmitted email is in WP or TNG  database, user is requested to Try Password Reset.
### Just one field, 'tng_interest' is added by this plugin in 'wp_usermeta' table. This field is used in New Registration Submission. 

## Login
### Logging in to Wordpress with user name or user email
### If login to Wordpress is successful, user is logged in to TNG
